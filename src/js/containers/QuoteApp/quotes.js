    explanation: "<i>A metaphor to explain</i>:<br/>A broken car can stand by the road for a long time, untouched. But as soon as a window is broken, it will be stripped to the bottom in no time.<br/><br/>As soon as you encounter something that isn't maintained. You will not have the mood nor the motivation to continue working on it with clean coding. 'It's already cluttered.'",
